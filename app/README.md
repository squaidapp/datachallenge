# README.md

This README file provides an overview of the Python code and its usage. The code is designed to serve as a FastAPI web service that handles data uploads, metrics calculations, and predictions related to employee data, departments, and jobs. Below, you'll find information on how to use the code and its requirements.

## Requirements

Before you can use this code, make sure you have the following requirements in place:

- **Python 3**: The code is written in Python, so you need Python 3 installed on your system.

- **Required Python Packages**:
  - `fastapi`: This package is used to create the FastAPI application and handle HTTP requests.
  - `mangum`: It is used to adapt the FastAPI application for AWS Lambda.
  - `uvicorn`: Required for running the FastAPI application.

- **Third-party Packages**:
  - `numpy`: A popular numerical computing package for Python.
  - `boto3`: For interacting with AWS services, specifically for RDS and Lambda.
  - `mysql-connector`: Used for connecting to a MySQL database.
  - `keras`: Required for building and training a neural network model.
  
- **Local Files**:
  - The code relies on local files, such as `functions_api.py`, which likely contains utility functions used by the main code. Make sure you have this file available and properly configured for your environment.

- **Environment Variables**:
  - You need to configure environment variables related to AWS RDS and other settings. These environment variables should be set in your AWS Lambda environment or wherever you deploy the code.

## Code Explanation

The code consists of several API endpoints and functions for various purposes. Here's a brief explanation of each:

1. **`read_root`**: A test endpoint that checks the connection to the RDS database.

2. **`jobs_upload`**: Endpoint for uploading job data in CSV format to the RDS database.

3. **`departments_upload`**: Endpoint for uploading department data in CSV format to the RDS database.

4. **`employees_upload`**: Endpoint for uploading employee data in CSV format to the RDS database. It also validates the data against existing job and department records.

5. **`quarterhires`**: Calculates and returns quarterly hiring metrics by department and job.

6. **`topdepartments`**: Retrieves and returns departments with above-average hiring metrics.

7. **`predict_hires`**: Predicts the number of hires for a given department for the next month using a neural network model.

8. The code also includes the main function for running the FastAPI application using `uvicorn`.

## Usage

1. Ensure you have the required Python packages installed. You can use `pip install` to install missing packages.

2. Set up the necessary environment variables as specified in the `ENV_VARIABLES` dictionary. These variables are essential for connecting to the RDS database and other configurations.

3. Make sure the `functions_api.py` file contains the utility functions needed by the code, especially for retrieving RDS credentials.

4. Deploy the FastAPI application, for example, on AWS Lambda using the `mangum` adapter, to expose the endpoints as HTTP APIs.

5. You can access the API endpoints according to your requirements. For data uploads, use the appropriate endpoint and submit CSV files. For metrics and predictions, make GET requests to the respective endpoints.

6. The code includes error handling, so you should receive appropriate responses in case of success or failure.

7. The code can be extended and customized according to your specific use case and data sources.

Please make sure to adjust the code as needed for your specific environment and requirements.
